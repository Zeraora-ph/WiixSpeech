## About this Project

Do you need to practice your english pronunciation? 
Don't know or forget how to pronounce some words? Also, have trouble hearing or understanding some words in English?

I asked these questions for myself and the answer to both was Yes. So, I developed a Mobile application in which you can add as many as you want to a playlist and listen to them repeatedly every day, all day and free. (Really free! No ads, no accounts upgrades or some else bullshits).


## Considering donating us.

I did it with my heart, tho the company that produces beer does not do it, so, considering donating us.
